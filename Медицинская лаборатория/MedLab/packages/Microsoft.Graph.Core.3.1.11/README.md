[![NuGet Version](https://buildstats.info/nuget/Microsoft.Graph.Core)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph.Core/)

Integrate the [Microsoft Graph API](https://graph.microsoft.com) into your .NET
project!

The Microsoft Graph .NET Core Client Library contains core classes and interfaces used by [Microsoft.Graph Client Library](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet) to send native HTTP requests to [Microsoft Graph API](https://graph.microsoft.com). The latest core client library targets .NetStandard 2.0.

## Installation via NuGet

To install the client library via NuGet:

* Search for `Microsoft.Graph.Core` in the NuGet Library, or
* Type `Install-Package Microsoft.Graph.Core` into the Package Manager Console.

## Getting started

### 1. Register your application

Register your application to use Microsoft Graph API by following the steps at [Register your application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2).

### 2. Authenticate for the Microsoft Graph service

The Microsoft Graph .NET Client Library supports the use of TokenCredential classes in the [Azure.Identity](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Identity) library.

You can read more about available Credential classes [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme#key-concepts) and examples on how to quickly setup TokenCredential instances can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet/blob/feature/5.0/docs/tokencredentials.md).

The recommended library for authenticating against Microsoft Identity (Azure AD) is [MSAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet).

For an example of authenticating a UWP app using the V2 Authentication Endpoint, see the [Microsoft Graph UWP Connect Library](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Graph-UWP-Connect-Library).

### 3. Create a HttpClient object with an authentication provider

You can create an instance of **HttpClient** that is pre-configured for making requests to Microsoft Graph APIs using `GraphClientFactory`.

```cs
HttpClient httpClient = GraphClientFactory.Create( version: "beta");
```

For more information on initializing a client instance, see the [library overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/sdks-overview)

### 4. Make requests to the graph

Once you have an authenticated `HttpClient`, you can begin to make calls to the service. The requests to the service follows our [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/use-the-api) syntax.

For example, to retrieve a user's default drive:

```cs
HttpRequestMessage requestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, "me/drive");
HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.SendAsync(requestMessage);
if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
{
    string jsonResponse = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
}
```

To get the current user's root folder of their default drive:

```cs
HttpRequestMessage requestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, "me/drive/root");
HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.SendAsync(requestMessage);
if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
{
    string jsonResponse = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
}
```

## Building library locally

If you are looking to build the library locally for the purposes of contributing code or running tests, you will need to:

* Have the .NET Core SDK (> 1.0) installed
* Run `dotnet restore` from the command line in your package directory
* Run `nuget restore` and `msbuild` from CLI or run Build from Visual Studio to restore Nuget packages and build the project

> Run `dotnet build -p:IncludeMauiTargets=true` if you wish to build the MAUI targets for the projects as well.
